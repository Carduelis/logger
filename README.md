# logger

Logger app works with Google Firebase Cloud.

To _start_ **dev server** you need run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

It opens `0.0.0.0:3107`, but there is need to change url to `localhost:3107` or `YOUR.LOCAL.IP.ADDRESS:3107`

To _create_ **build** you need run:

```
npm run build
```
